Security is hard.

### Security

* [On the security of containers](https://medium.com/@ewindisch/on-the-security-of-containers-2c60ffe25a9e)
> Your OS offers security tunables for your processes and you’re probably not using them. Docker is the tool that makes these usable and work, largely, out-of-the-box.

* How does this all work?

```diff
     // to expand it out into a comma-delimited set of placeholders.
     foreach (array_filter($args, 'is_array') as $key => $data) {
       $new_keys = array();
-      foreach ($data as $i => $value) {
+      foreach (array_values($data) as $i => $value) {
         // This assumes that there are no other placeholders that use the same
         // name.  For example, if the array placeholder is defined as :example
         // and there is already an :example_2 placeholder, this will generate
```

>So you've bought yourselves a top of the line devops appliance. Everything is great. But, from what you've heard from Twitter, the next thing you need is a security. My talk is about the next steps. To get from zero to well at least better than most of the industry.
