### Security

* More removing code...[OpenBSD removes loadable kernel modules](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/current.html#20141013)

* Yup

* [One wireless hotspot for every 150 people](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29726632) - I still think that if there is any money for "Internet infrastrucutre" that some of it should be spent on things like dd-wrt. Wireless routers must be one of the most insecure devices in existence.

* [Verizon Injecting Perma-Cookies to Track Mobile Customers, Bypassing Privacy Controls](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/verizon-x-uidh)
>Like a cookie, this header uniquely identifies users to the websites they visit. Verizon adds the header at the network level, between the user's device and the servers with which the user interacts. Unlike a cookie, the header is tied to a data plan, so anyone who browses the web through a hotspot, or shares a computer that uses cellular data, gets the same X-UIDH header as everyone else using that hotspot or computer. That means advertisers may build a profile that reveals private browsing activity to coworkers, friends, or family through targeted advertising.

* [Hacker Lexicon: What Is Homomorphic Encryption?](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/hacker-lexicon-homomorphic-encryption/)
> A homomorphic encryption scheme is a crypto system that allows computations to be performed on data without decrypting it. A homomorphically encrypted search engine, for instance, could take in encrypted search terms and compare them with an encrypted index of the web. Or a homomorphically encrypted financial database stored in the cloud would allow users to ask how much money an employee earned in the second quarter of 2013. But it would accept an encrypted employee name and output an encrypted answer, avoiding the privacy problems that usually plague online services that deal with such sensitive data.
