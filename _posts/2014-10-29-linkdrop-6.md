>“If you thought the state of cyber defense had become substantially better in the last ten years, you’d be wrong,” he said. “We’ve been waling backward on cybersecurity for more than a decade and we’ll continue to walk backward unless and until we can address the core issues. The defensive stance needs to change from filter and guard to hunt and kill.”
