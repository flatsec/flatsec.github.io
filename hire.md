My name is Curtis Collicutt and I am a systems adminstrator specializing in information security. Previously I have held certifications such as the [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/cissp/Default.aspx) and [GCUX](http://www.giac.org/certification/certified-unix-security-administrator-gcux), and have been employed as a systems security administrator for large organizations. I enjoy working in the DevOps paradigm and have worked in teams implementing agile and scrum methodologies. I believe inforsec is largely about saying "yes" instead of a flat "no."

If you have an interesting infosec related position open and think I might be a good fit, please feel free to contact me.

### Sabbatical

Currently I am on a four to six month long self-imposed sabbatical during which I'm writing about and researching various technology areas such as information security, OpenStack infrastructure, [Platform-as-a-service](http://serverascode.com/2014/06/16/build-your-own-paas-docker.html), [Docker](http://docker.com), and distributed systems such as [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/). There is a tremendous number of new and interesting technogies available and I am taking time to learn about and use those technologies. Currently I am studying for the _Certified Ethical Hacker_ certification exam.

Writing posts for this blog is a big part of that learning process, and, as well, I'm working with publishers on a couple of technical book ideas.

### Open Source

I love open source software, including operating systems such as Linux and OpenBSD. I've worked heavily with the Ubuntu and Redhat distributions of Linux. I have also deployed private OpenStack clouds and am an enthusiastic user of automation tools such as Ansible and Puppet.

I have contributed to open source software projects. I am particularliy enamored with the Go language right now and am working to improve my development skills, especially in that language.

### OpenStack

I'm a big fan of OpenStack--I've deployed a private cloud using OpenStack (way back on the Essex release) and I've got extensive experience with OpenStack Swift, the object storage system, which I have deployed via several methods, from using Ansible to create a multi-datacenter system, to a [single small Swift instance using Docker](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/serverascode/swift-onlyone/).

### Distributed systems and service discovery

Distributed systems and service discovery are also interesting to me, and I am working to learn about new implementations such as CoreOS' etcd or Hashicorp's Consul, among others. Given my emphasis on infosec I am keenly interested in having a good knowledgebase with regards to these technolgies so that I can participate in securing them.

I am also interested in the CAP theorem, which could be [rephrased](https://twitter.com/randyshoup/status/516920465571725313):

> Consistent or available **when** partitioned.

While I am not an academic researcher, I do find distributed systems to be fascinating, and believe that systems like Apache Mesos and Mesosphere's Marathon (plus Docker) will allow the creation of some spectacular systems.

### Infosec Position

Even though I am on a self-imposed sabbatical, I am currently looking for employment in an infosec role, especially one related to cloud or distributed infrastructure.

I am a Canadian citizen living in [Edmonton, Alberta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton) (which, surprising to some, is a wonderful place, especially in the summer, and is home to about million people), and would consider relocating for a great opportunity. Working remotely would be awesome too.

If you are looking for a technical systems adminstrator to take an infosec related role in your organization, I would love to hear from you.

#### Why Flatline?

I am a fan of William Gibson's writing, and [Dixie Flatline](http://www.shmoop.com/neuromancer/dixie-flatline.html) is a character in Neuromancer.
